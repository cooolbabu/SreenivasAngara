      <description>Declarative programming will expedite the Return on Investment in your modern data warehouse implementation.
I recently watched Michael Armbrust&amp;rsquo;s insightful presentation at the Data + AI Summit 2023, where he initiated the discussion by emphasizing the advantages of Declarative Programming. Throughout his talk, he delved into the innovative features of Delta Live Tables, DLT Pipelines, HMR, serverless computing, Enzyme, and more.
His primary message, &amp;ldquo;Declarative programs specify what should be done, not how to do it&amp;rdquo; left a lasting impression.</description>

      <description>Platform Scale for a Post-Pandemic world by Sangeet Paul Choudry says
Platform manifesto - The Invisible Hand is the new Iron Fist
&amp;ldquo;In a networked age, we are moving from a world of command and control to a self-serve world where participation is encouraged through an invisible hand powered by data, API and algorithms.&amp;rdquo; - Chapter 1.4, page 45
Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s concept of the Invisible Hand, outlined in his renowned work &amp;ldquo;The Wealth of Nations&amp;rdquo; in 1776, proposes that individuals pursuing their own self-interest inadvertently contribute to the greater good of society.</description>

      <guid>https://cooolbabu.github.io/SreenivasAngara/posts/azurecopyactivity/</guid>
      <description>Think of Azure Data Factory&amp;rsquo;s Copy Activity as the Swiss Army knife of data integration. Just as a Swiss Army knife combines various tools into one compact design, Copy Activity seamlessly combines multiple data integration functions into a single, powerful feature.
Versatility: Just like a Swiss Army knife&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle various tasks, Copy Activity connects to diverse data sources and destinations, whether they&amp;rsquo;re in the cloud or on-premises.
Efficiency: Like a Swiss Army knife&amp;rsquo;s efficiency in handling different tasks, Copy Activity streamlines data movement and transformation in a single step.</description>

      <description>In a world fueled by technology, the concept of Digital Twins has emerged as a groundbreaking bridge between the physical and digital realms. Imagine having a virtual counterpart for real-world objects, processes, or systems that mimics their behavior and characteristics in real time. This technology is not just about static models â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s about creating dynamic, synchronized virtual entities that offer a wealth of benefits across industries.
Digital Twins rely on a mix of technologies like IoT, data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing.</description>

      <description>As an enterprise architect, using text-based diagrams can be a smarter approach for several reasons. Text-based diagrams offer superior portability and accessibility, as they are lightweight and can be shared as plain text files through various communication channels, reaching a broader audience without the need for specialized software. Furthermore, by being version-controlled using tools like Git, text-based diagrams facilitate seamless collaboration among team members, enabling efficient tracking of changes and supporting geographically dispersed teams.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Regression models</title>
      <link>https://cooolbabu.github.io/SreenivasAngara/posts/non-linearregression/</link>

      <description>Non-linear regression is a powerful technique used in statistics and machine learning to model and analyze complex relationships between variables. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, non-linear regression algorithms can capture more intricate and non-linear patterns. This makes them particularly useful when dealing with real-world phenomena where linear relationships are insufficient.
Following Non-Linear regression models are covered in the attached Jypter notebook</description>

      <description>During an interview process, interviewers generally ask and expect textbook definitions of basic terms. Interviewees, on the other hand must be prepared and answer them promptly. Lengthy and exploratory answers prevent interviewers from asking more probing questions.
Confidence Interval A confidence interval is a range of values around the point estimate, constructed so that this range will contain the population parameter with a certain degree of confidence, expressed in percentage terms.</description>
