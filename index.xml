      <description>In a world fueled by technology, the concept of Digital Twins has emerged as a groundbreaking bridge between the physical and digital realms. Imagine having a virtual counterpart for real-world objects, processes, or systems that mimics their behavior and characteristics in real time. This technology is not just about static models â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s about creating dynamic, synchronized virtual entities that offer a wealth of benefits across industries.
Digital Twins rely on a mix of technologies like IoT, data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing.</description>

      <description>As an enterprise architect, using text-based diagrams can be a smarter approach for several reasons. Text-based diagrams offer superior portability and accessibility, as they are lightweight and can be shared as plain text files through various communication channels, reaching a broader audience without the need for specialized software. Furthermore, by being version-controlled using tools like Git, text-based diagrams facilitate seamless collaboration among team members, enabling efficient tracking of changes and supporting geographically dispersed teams.</description>

      <description>Non-linear regression is a powerful technique used in statistics and machine learning to model and analyze complex relationships between variables. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables, non-linear regression algorithms can capture more intricate and non-linear patterns. This makes them particularly useful when dealing with real-world phenomena where linear relationships are insufficient.
Following Non-Linear regression models are covered in the attached Jypter notebook</description>

      <description>During my participation in the MIT-GreatLearning Applied Data Science Program, I experienced an intensive curriculum that encompassed diverse subjects such as Statistics, Python programming, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Recommendation Systems.
The culmination of the program was the Capstone project, which aimed to predict Loan Default. This involved crucial steps like Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis, constructing models, and generating a comprehensive performance report for the various models employed.
The final outcome is a binary classification.</description>

      <description>During an interview process, interviewers generally ask and expect textbook definitions of basic terms. Interviewees, on the other hand must be prepared and answer them promptly. Lengthy and exploratory answers prevent interviewers from asking more probing questions.
Confidence Interval A confidence interval is a range of values around the point estimate, constructed so that this range will contain the population parameter with a certain degree of confidence, expressed in percentage terms.</description>
