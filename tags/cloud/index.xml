      <description>Platform Scale for a Post-Pandemic world by Sangeet Paul Choudry says
Platform manifesto - The Invisible Hand is the new Iron Fist
&amp;ldquo;In a networked age, we are moving from a world of command and control to a self-serve world where participation is encouraged through an invisible hand powered by data, API and algorithms.&amp;rdquo; - Chapter 1.4, page 45
Adam Smith&amp;rsquo;s concept of the Invisible Hand, outlined in his renowned work &amp;ldquo;The Wealth of Nations&amp;rdquo; in 1776, proposes that individuals pursuing their own self-interest inadvertently contribute to the greater good of society.</description>

      <description>Think of Azure Data Factory&amp;rsquo;s Copy Activity as the Swiss Army knife of data integration. Just as a Swiss Army knife combines various tools into one compact design, Copy Activity seamlessly combines multiple data integration functions into a single, powerful feature.
Versatility: Just like a Swiss Army knife&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle various tasks, Copy Activity connects to diverse data sources and destinations, whether they&amp;rsquo;re in the cloud or on-premises.
Efficiency: Like a Swiss Army knife&amp;rsquo;s efficiency in handling different tasks, Copy Activity streamlines data movement and transformation in a single step.</description>

      <description>In a world fueled by technology, the concept of Digital Twins has emerged as a groundbreaking bridge between the physical and digital realms. Imagine having a virtual counterpart for real-world objects, processes, or systems that mimics their behavior and characteristics in real time. This technology is not just about static models â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s about creating dynamic, synchronized virtual entities that offer a wealth of benefits across industries.
Digital Twins rely on a mix of technologies like IoT, data analytics, machine learning, and cloud computing.</description>
